# Recipes-app

This is an Express recipe sharing app that has social media applications. For our models we utilized a user schema for uploads to the website/app, and a recipe model schema for the user to see what goes into a specific recipe.

We mostly collaborated in liveshare and worked in conjunction with each other to troubleshoot problems as they came up.

We added an image upload capability by adding it as a property to the Recipe schema and installed 2 additional middleware packages called Multer and Cloudinary.

The struggle of working independently from each other is not knowing if your code might conflict with something that one of your colleagues is working on although it might be quicker for indepedent testing.

Some of the unsolved problems on our site is getting a specific users show page to display the chosen user's recipes-- instead the user show page will only display the recipes of the person logged in.

The CSS styling incorporates some smooth keyframe animations and a consistent color scheme that gives the site the feel of a real modern app.
